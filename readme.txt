= Why use Amazon landing pages? =
Using external traffic, such as Facebook ads, is a great way to boost your Amazon. Using traffic from outside of Amazon, you can get an edge over competing Amazon sellers, by selling more units, boosting your rankings, and getting more Amazon reviews.

However, there's a mistake with driving traffic that many sellers make: they drive traffic straight to Amazon.

Driving traffic from outside of Amazon to your listing often negatively impacts your conversion rate (as shoppers on Amazon are more likey to buy), which in turn could possibly negatively impact your Amazon rankings.

Not only that, it's also a missed opportunity. Since you're putting in a lot of effort to drive traffic (such as buying Facebook ads), why would you just hand over *your customers* straight to Amazon?

LandingCube lets you create beautiful coupon landing pages, where your prospects can claim single-use promotional codes in exchange for their email address.

This accomplishes a few things:

1. You'll sell more units than you'd have otherwise, increasing your sales velocity and BSR.

2. You'll capture emails. You can email these people the next time you run a promotion on Amazon, or even to promote your own e-commerce store. (Since these emails are *yours*, this is 100% allowed by Amazon's terms of service.)

3. The conversion rate on your listing will be higher, so your rankings won't hurt.
